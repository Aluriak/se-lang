# Space Engine modding language abstraction
Using either [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming),
define complete systems in SpaceEngine.

For motivations, see [my blog entry about this repository](lucas.bourneuf.net/blog/se-lang.html).


## Example
Let's say you want to reproduce a simple solar system with a sun, an earth and a moon.

In ASP, you would write:

```asp
root(sun,"My Simple System","MSS").
orbit(sun,orbit(earth,moon,"0.01"),1).
```

In JSON, you would write:

```json
{
    "name": "My Simple System",
    "UID": "MSS",
    "type": "sun",
    "child": {
        "type": "earth",
        "distance": 1,
        "child": {
            "type": "moon",
            "distance": 0.01
        }
    }
}
```


## Interest of se-lang over the modding language
The modding language of SpaceEngine is very well documented and powerful. However, beyond the simple cases described in the doc,
you end up writing python scripts [to automatize some standard things, like rings](lucas.bourneuf.net/blog/uess.html).

Instead of rewriting new python scripts each time, here it is: an internal model to rule them all. An internal model to be created by any format.
An internal model to use for any case.


## ASP vs JSON
ASP is (logical) programming language, JSON is a text format, so they differ in so many ways,
you can assume they are different things.

The ideal language to abstract modding of SpaceEngine is probably not one of these two,
but i had fun making the corresponding interpreters, and using them for some [use cases](lucas.bourneuf.net/blog/se-lang.html).

Currently, the JSON implementation support much more features.

[JSON implementation](json_model.py). [ASP implementation](asp_model.py).



## dev
- [x] ASP input
- [x] JSON input
- [x] reproduce Kalgash systems from [planetplanet.net](https://planetplanet.net/2018/03/21/asimov-kalgash-take2/)
- [x] reproduce [UESS](https://lucas.bourneuf.net/blog/uess.html)
- [ ] find a way to simplify UESS encoding (probably something to repeat orbit with gaps).
- [x] allow use of non-standard name for objects. Something like `planet(class,radius,mass)` or `star(spectral_class,radius,mass)`.
- [ ] injection of arbitrary SpaceEngine script code.
- [x] full orbit definition. Probably the distance argument could be replaced by a `(distance,eccentricity,â€¦)`.
- [ ] testing suite
